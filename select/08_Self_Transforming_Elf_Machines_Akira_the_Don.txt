I encounter self transforming elf machines
Which are creatures entities, perhaps
Although they're not made out of matter
They're made out of syntax driving life
It's one of the most challenging parts
Of the whole psychedelic landscape
Most people can accept the idea of
Disordered sensory input
Recovery of traumatic memory material
But what are we to do with an elf?
What are we to do with an elf?
What What are we to do with an elf?
You know, that becomes a little harder to
Contextualize in psychoanalytic theory
Although Jung did a good job when he said
Autonomous elements can escape from
The psyche's control
And present themselves as
Independent entities
I'm not sure he's ever seen
A self transforming elf machine
It's the defining characteristic of
The true DMT Flash i mean, it is not subtle
These things mob you like
Badly trained rottweilers
They come bounding forward by the dozens
By the hundreds they jump into your body
They jump out of your body i mean, it maps
To some degree over the archetype
Of the little people
The leprechaun, the fay
And being Irish and being Jungian
I'm willing to entertain
You know maybe I have a
Special relationship to this stuff but then
In the Amazon the people using
DMT that I studied
The reason they did it, they said
Was to speak with the little people
Was to speak with the little people
What are we to do with an elf?
What are we to do with an elf?
What are we to do with an elf?
What are we to do with an elf?
What puzzles me about my
Contacts with these beings
It conforms to, let's say, the Irish model
They are small, full of merriment
Almost to a manic and frightening level
It's sort of like a Bugs
Bunny cartoon gone berserk
They are friendly, but play rough
It's a land of explosions and falling anvils
The overwhelming feeling is
Love is kind of crazy, childish affection
And they're delighted to have
Me in their presence
These entities have an agenda
It's a very curious agenda
They use a language, which, you see
It is made out of sound, but you see it
And the entire point of the encounter
Seems to be to teach you to do this
They want you to transform your language
They want you to speak
Elfish but you know what?
If you've never done DMT and
You just smoked it
And you're 30 seconds into this experience
And this is what it's come down to
What are we to do with an elf?
What are we to do with an elf?
What are we to do with an elf?
What are we to do with an elf?
